# Zero Matrix Problem

## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix, the task is to modify the matrix in place. The modification required is that if an element in the matrix is `0`, then its entire row and column should be set to `0`. This needs to be done efficiently, utilizing in-place algorithm techniques to ensure minimal space usage.

## Approach

The solution involves a two-pass algorithm:

1. **First Pass**: Identify the rows and columns that need to be zeroed. This is done by iterating through the matrix and using the first row and first column as markers. If a cell in the matrix is `0`, its corresponding first row and first column cells are set to `0`.

2. **Second Pass**: Utilize the markers set in the first pass to zero out the appropriate rows and columns. This is done by iterating through the matrix again and setting the cell to `0` if its corresponding row or column marker is `0`.

3. **Special Handling for First Row and Column**: Since the first row and first column are used as markers, their original state (whether they should be zeroed or not) needs to be stored before the first pass. After the second pass, the first row and column are zeroed out if their original state had a `0`.

## Implementation

The implementation in Python is as follows:

```python
def setZeroes(matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    first_row_has_zero = not all(matrix[0][j] for j in range(n))
    first_col_has_zero = not all(matrix[i][0] for i in range(m))

    # Mark zeros on first row and column
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][0] = matrix[0][j] = 0

    # Use marks to set zeros
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    # Set first row and column to zero if needed
    if first_row_has_zero:
        for j in range(n):
            matrix[0][j] = 0
    if first_col_has_zero:
        for i in range(m):
            matrix[i][0] = 0
```

## Usage

To use this function, simply call `setZeroes(matrix)` where `matrix` is your `m x n` matrix.

Example:

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
]
setZeroes(matrix)
print("Modified matrix:")
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
```

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m*n) - The matrix is iterated over twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - No additional space is used, modifications are done in place.

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently solves the problem with minimal space usage, making it suitable for large matrices where space is a concern.
